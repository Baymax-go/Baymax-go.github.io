<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a PhD student in Control Science and Engineering at Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU), supervised by Prof. [Yue Gao](https://gaoyue.sjtu.edu.cn/).
Currently, I am conducting researches on Embodied AI at [Shanghai Innovation Institute](https://www.sii.edu.cn/) and [MoE key lab of Artificial Intelligence](https://ailab-moe.sjtu.edu.cn/).
Previously, I received my bachelor's degree in Measurement and Control Technology from Jilin University. 

My research interest includes: Vision-Language-Action (VLA), World Model, RL Post-training, Robust Whole-body control for humanoid robots; 

I am a **final-year PhD candidate** at SJTU, expected to **graduate in June 2027**. Currently, I am actively **seeking research internships or jobs about Embodied AI.**
